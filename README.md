## Hi there!

My name is **Sergio Oliva**. In the world of aviation and simulation I use **Glide Brick** as my nickname.
This is my attempt to have presence in the web in the form of a 'home page' where I can point my social media and host some other content.

### About me  

I guess there is no point on having a personal website if it doesn't say a thing about me, so here we go...  

_I'm a happy husband (that's something not everybody can say), in my forty-something (while by no means athletic, I admit to being satisfied with my looks), father of three (am I entitled to feel as some kind of super hero?), living and working in [Madrid](https://goo.gl/maps/fJrff5frWsmPysM16) and currently getting my [ULM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tecnam_P2002_Sierra) license. In summary, I'm not rich, but overall I can't complain, it's fairly good to be me._

This is surely not enough for you to get an idea about _who_ am I. Well, as they say, _tell me what are your hobbies and i'll tell you who you are_.

### Hobbies  

I've had a good number of them. I'm the kind that gets hooked by almost anything that hides some mistery that can be unveiled with practice, study and improvement. Some of them have lasted along the years. Some other were just temporary. But all of these have been important for me at some point.  No particular order.

- Have I already mentioned **Aviation**? This has been my deepest obsession ever, and at my mid-forties, I'm so happy to be able to practice it both simulated and the real deal.
- **Guitar**; I have one [electric](https://www.instagram.com/p/kh5hCTHe7_/) and one [acoustic](https://www.instagram.com/p/MoEmFMne6k/) guitar, but my skills went rusty long ago. Not that I've ever been really good at it, but I've enjoyed them for quite some time.
- **Motorbikes**; I had my first bike at the age of 10 or so. I've had nearly 20 different bikes until the birth of my first kid on 2010. That's roughly 35 years biking. And when I say biking, I mean most of that time I didn't even have a car. My bike was a way of life.  
- I'm a qualified **dog trainer**. Got my trainer certificate working with Mara, my West Highland White Terrier. She did great. Rest in peace. I also have a Belgiand Shepperd, Judy. She's awesome. [Both](https://www.instagram.com/p/NouNMyne_7/) are.
- **Archery**; I used to have a [compound bow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_bow) and went to an archery club with friends.
- **Photography**. Yes, not only can I point and shoot, I can do it with a reflex in full-manual mode and get the pic I want, the way I want. I currently own a [Canon EOS 50D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_EOS_50D). I can then process my photographs to a good extent in Photoshop. I sometimes use this skill to paint liveries for flight simulators planes.
- **Cockpit gaming**; meaning that, besides flight simulation, I also play other games, but most if not all of them involve some kind of driving, piloting, sailing or whatever vehicle that can be virtually handled.
- **Zen meditation**; though I've only been relatively successful at it.
- **Writing**; they say a man has to do three things in life, and one of them is to write a book. I have attempted it more than twice, but I', still struggling. Blogging, journalling and other forms of writing have not really been much more successful for me. But hey, I'm still in my mid-forties and I still expect I can do it.
- **A few more I'll be including**... sometime.

### Social media  

In fact, you probably arrived here from one of these:

- **[Glide Brick's Twitter](https://twitter.com/GlideBrick)**. Oh, I also have a ['personal' Twitter account](https://twitter.com/serolrom), but it's not nearly as interesting as Glide Brick's one.
- **[Glide Brick's Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/glidebrick/)**. Yep, there's also a personal instagram, [here](https://www.instagram.com/top_gun_powah/).
- **Facebook**. Err... No, I don't have Facebook. I used to, but I hated it, and one day I found the courage to **delete my account** for good. I was glad to find I did't get erased from the universe. I got so happy that I ended up **deleting my Whatsapp** too!

### Contact me

In addition to the above social media channels, you can reach me by e-mail. Just put my first and last name together and send it to Gmail. Same with my nickname. Drop me a line any time!

### What's next

Enough for a 'home page'. I'll include here a link pointing to some more content (when such content exist). I found that blogs don't work for me, so I'll post whatever content I feel like publishing, not necessarily fitting tags like _blog, journal, gallery_, etc...


Thanks for dropping by!  
_Sergio_
