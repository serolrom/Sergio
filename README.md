## Hi there!

My name is Sergio Oliva. In the world of aviation and simulation I use Glide Brick as my nickname.
This is my naive attempt to have presence in the web in the form of a 'home page' where I can point my social media.

### About me  
I guess there is no point of having a personal website if it doesn't say a thing about me, so...  
I'm a happy husband (not many can say), father of three (am I entitled to feel as some kind of super hero?), living and working in [Madrid](https://goo.gl/maps/fJrff5frWsmPysM16) and currently getting my [ULM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tecnam_P2002_Sierra) license.



... and I'm currently after my ULM license. 

... these are my ...  

### Hobbies  

I've had a good number of them. I'm the kind that gets hooked by almost anything that hides some mistery that can be unveiled with practice, study and improvement. Some of them have lasted along the years. Some other were just temporary. But all of these have been important for me at some point.  No particular order.

- Have I already mentioned **Aviation**? This has been my deepest obsession ever, and at my mid-forties, I'm so happy to be able to practice it both simulated and the real deal.
- Guitar; I have one electric and one acoustic guitar, but my skills went rusty long ago.  
- Archery; I used to have a [compound bow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_bow) and went to a club with friends.
- Photography. Yes, not only can I point and shoot, I can do it with a reflex in full-manual mode and get pic I want the way I want. I currently own a [Canon EOS 50D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_EOS_50D). I can then process my photographs to a good extent in Photoshop. I sometimes use this skill to paint liveries for flight simulators planes.
- Cockpit gaming; meaning that, besides flight simulation, I also play other games, but most if not all of them involve some kind of driving, piloting, sailing or whatever vehicle that can be virtually handled.

### Social media  

In fact, you probably arrived here from one of these:

- [Glide Brick's Twitter](https://twitter.com/GlideBrick). Oh, I also have a ['personal' Twitter account](https://twitter.com/serolrom), but it's not nearly as interesting as Glide Brick's one.
- [Glide Brick's Instagram]
- **Facebook**. Err... No, I don't have Facebook. I used to, but I hated it, and one day I found the courage to **delete my account** for good. I was glad to find I did't get erased from the universe. I got so happy that I ended up **deleting my Whatsapp** too!
