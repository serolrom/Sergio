## Hi there!

My name is Sergio Oliva. In the world of aviation and simulation I use Glide Brick as my nickname.
This is my naive attempt to have presence in the web in the form of a 'home page' where I can point my social media.

### About me  
I guess there is no point of having a personal website if it doesn't say a thing about me, so here it is my self-description 



... and I'm currently after my ULM license. 

... these are my ...

### Hobbies  
- Have I already mentioned **Aviation**?
- Guitar (I have one electric and one acoustic guitar, but my skills went rusty long ago)  
- Photography  
- Cockpit gaming (meaning that, besides flight simulation, I also play other games, but most if not all of them involve some kind of driving, piloting, sailing or whatever vehicle that can be virtually handled)

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/serolrom/website/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/serolrom/website/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
